# Machine-Learning

In this exercise, I implemented linear regression and get to see it work
on data, logistic regression and applied it to two
dierent datasets, one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits, the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition and regularized linear regression and use it to
study models with dierent bias-variance properties.
